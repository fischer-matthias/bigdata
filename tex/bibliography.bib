@book{Burger.2015,
 abstract = {In der {\"u}berarbeiteten und inhaltlich erweiterten Neuauflage des international erfolgreichen Klassikers, der von Praktikern und Dozenten gerne eingesetzt wird, geben die Autoren eine fundierte Einf{\"u}hrung in die wichtigsten Methoden der digitalen Bildverarbeitung und ausgew{\"a}hlte Verfahren, die in {\"a}hnlich umfassender Form sonst kaum zu finden sind. Die praktische Anwendbarkeit steht dabei im Vordergrund, w{\"a}hrend formale Aspekte auf das Wesentliche reduziert sind. Die anerkannten St{\"a}rken dieses Buchs sind einerseits die ungew{\"o}hnlich hohe Detaillierung sowie die pr{\"a}zise algorithmische Beschreibung und unmittelbare Verbindung zwischen mathematischer Beschreibung und konkreter Implementierung. Der Text eignet sich als detaillierte Referenz f{\"u}r Praktiker und Anwender g{\"a}ngiger moderner Verfahren, z.B. in der Robotik, Medizin, Biologie, Astronomie, Medientechnik oder Materialpr{\"u}fung. Zugleich bildet das Buch eine Basis f{\"u}r die Lehre oder das Selbststudium und wird an vielen Hochschulen weltweit erfolgreich eingesetzt. Konkrete {\"U}bungsaufgaben runden die Darstellungen ab. Die klar strukturierten Code-Beispiele basieren auf der in Java implementierten und frei verf{\"u}gbaren Bildverarbeitungssoftware ImageJ, sind aber davon weitgehend unabh{\"a}ngig. Source Code und erg{\"a}nzende Materialien finden sich online auf der zugeh{\"o}rigen Support-Site (www.imagingbook.com)},

@book{Chen.2014,
 abstract = {This Springer Brief provides a comprehensive overview of the background and recent developments of big data. The value chain of big data is divided into four phases: data generation, data acquisition, data storage and data analysis. For each phase, the book introduces the general background, discusses technical challenges and reviews the latest advances. Technologies under discussion include cloud computing, Internet of Things, data centers, Hadoop and more. The authors also explore several representative applications of big data such as enterprise management, online social networks, healthcare and medical applications, collective intelligence and smart grids. This book concludes with a thoughtful discussion of possible research directions and development trends in the field. Big Data: Related Technologies, Challenges and Future Prospects is a concise yet thorough examination of this exciting area. It is designed for researchers and professionals interested in big data or related research. Advanced-level students in computer science and electrical engineering will also find this book useful},

@book{HabibiAghdam.2017,
 abstract = {Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition -- Pattern Classification -- Convolutional Neural Networks -- Caffe Library -- Classification of Traffic Signs -- Detecting Traffic Signs -- Visualizing Neural Networks -- Appendix A: Gradient Descend



This must-read text/reference introduces the fundamental concepts of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), offering practical guidance on using libraries to implement ConvNets in applications of traffic sign detection and classification. The work presents techniques for optimizing the computational efficiency of ConvNets, as well as visualization techniques to better understand the underlying processes. The proposed models are also thoroughly evaluated from different perspectives, using exploratory and quantitative analysis. Topics and features: Explains the fundamental concepts behind training linear classifiers and feature learning Discusses the wide range of loss functions for training binary and multi-class classifiers Illustrates how to derive ConvNets from fully connected neural networks, and reviews different techniques for evaluating neural networks Presents a practical library for implementing ConvNets, explaining how to use a Python interface for the library to create and assess neural networks Describes two real-world examples of the detection and classification of traffic signs using deep learning methods Examines a range of varied techniques for visualizing neural networks, using a Python interface Provides self-study exercises at the end of each chapter, in addition to a helpful glossary, with relevant Python scripts supplied at an associated website This self-contained guide will benefit those who seek to both understand the theory behind deep learning, and to gain hands-on experience in implementing ConvNets in practice. As no prior background knowledge in the field is required to follow the material, the book is ideal for all students of computer vision and machine learning, and will also be of great interest to practitioners working on autonomous cars and advanced driver assistance systems},

@book{Ketkar.2017,
 abstract = {Discover the practical aspects of implementing deep-learning solutions using the rich Python ecosystem. This book bridges the gap between the academic state-of-the-art and the industry state-of-the-practice by introducing you to deep learning frameworks such as Keras, Theano, and Caffe. The practicalities of these frameworks is often acquired by practitioners by reading source code, manuals, and posting questions on community forums, which tends to be a slow and a painful process. Deep Learning with Python allows you to ramp up to such practical know-how in a short period of time and focus more on the domain, models, and algorithms.This book briefly covers the mathematical prerequisites and fundamentals of deep learning, making this book a good starting point for software developers who want to get started in deep learning. A brief survey of deep learning architectures is also included.Deep Learning with Pythonalso introduces you to key concepts of automatic differentiation and GPU computation which, while not central to deep learning, are critical when it comes to conducting large scale experiments.What You Will LearnLeverage deep learning frameworks in Python namely, Keras, Theano, and Caffe Gain the fundamentals of deep learning with mathematical prerequisites Discover the practical considerations of large scale experiments Take deep learning models to production Who This Book Is ForSoftware developers who want to try out deep learning as a practical solution to a particular problem.Software developers in a data science team who want to take deep learning models developed by data scientists to production.  Nikhil S. Ketkar currently leads the Machine Learning Platform team at Flipkart, India's largest e-commerce company. He received his Ph.D. from Washington State University. Following that he conducted postdoctoral research at University of North Carolina at Charlotte, which was followed by a brief stint in high frequency trading at Transmaket in Chicago. More recently he led the data mining team in Guavus, a startup doing big data analytics in the telecom domain and Indix, a startup doing data science in the e-commerce domain. His research interests include machine learning and graph theory.
